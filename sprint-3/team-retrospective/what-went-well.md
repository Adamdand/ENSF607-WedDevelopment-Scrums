We came to an acceptable solution to the Print PDF button, where the button opens up the "PRINT TO PDF" page, allowing the user to print the entire webpage to pdf. This was an acceptable solution because all components in the webpage were required to be printed.

The webpage looks intuitive, and easy to use for a new time user. We are all very proud of our work and what we learned during this project!

We stuggled with the Print to PDF button because of the states of our code.
We better organize our code next time to deal with this problem in the future.

Still, we came to an acceptable solution to the Print PDF button, where the button opens up the "PRINT TO PDF" page, allowing the user to print the entire webpage to pdf. This was an acceptable solution because all components in the webpage were required to be printed.

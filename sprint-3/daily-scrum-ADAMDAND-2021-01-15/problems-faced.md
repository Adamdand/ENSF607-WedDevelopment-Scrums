After getting one of the website tables working, it was relatively easy to complete the rest of the tables.
Had some trouble with helpinhg Ivan get the components that are just text to work. The problem was that,
the display is the same as the input, and there needed to be an initial value in the database to display text in that field.
Worked with Ivan and Junwoo for a couple hours in zoom to get it working.
Biggest problem is the print button. As all of our website sections are in seperate .js files. Tried a couple different methods that I found online and on youtube, but most would not work in our case.

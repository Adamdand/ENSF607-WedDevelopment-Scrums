ended up using an older "Print to PDF" Button that I had created, which sends the user to the "Save to PDF" page, allowing the user to save everything on the webpage as a PDF easily. This was a good solution, as the requirements for this project wanted us to save everyting on the webpage to a PDF anyways. The formatting was relatively acceptable as well.

Finished formatting the print button, as well as any loose ends.

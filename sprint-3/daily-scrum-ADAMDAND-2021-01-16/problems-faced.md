The "Print to PDF" Button is still a challenge.
Junwoo found out that we probably need a wrapper, or have all of our printable sections under a common parent.
We discovered it would be a lot of work to re-work out code to make a print to PDF button.

I ended up reverting to an older "Print to PDF" Button that I had working the previous day. The button sends the user to
the "Save to PDF" screen. This is an acceptable solution, as all of the components on the webpage are required to be printed.
